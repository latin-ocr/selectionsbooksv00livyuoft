PREFACE.

Tmsn Selections are intended for boys who can make
out the easier portions of Caesar, but are not yet able
to eope with the longer and more involved sentences
· of Livy. They have been simplified mainly by the
omission of complicated periods or by splitting these
up into shorter sentences, where they seemed neces·
sary to the sense. This has been specially the method
adopted in dealing with the speeehes. In a few cases
the order of the words has been altered, where, by so
doing, the construction could b'e made plainer.

An Appendix on the Subjunctive Mood has been
added, by referring to which a boy can understand
the use of most, if not all, of the subjunctives occurring
in the text—an object of which the importance can,
perhaps, hardly be overestimated. Continual refer-
ence has been made in the Notes to this Appendix.
On grammatical points, Roby’s school Latin Grammar
has been referred to as ‘Roby‚ S. L. G.’
