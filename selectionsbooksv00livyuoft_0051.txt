N OTES. 35

6. 2. auspicato] a past participle pass. used by itself as
abl. abach, ‘the auspices having been taken,’ cf. 17. 1. A
general never set out for war (nor, indeed, was any important

usiness undertaken by the Romans) without first ascertaining
the will of the gods, by sacrifice. If the ‘ auspices’ were un-
favourable, the project was abandoned.

Pythice] Cf. note to 2. l.

numine instinctus] Numen (cf. an-nuo=‘t0 nod')=‘a
nod of the head,' and then ‘the expression of one's will,'
especially ‘the expression of the divine will.’ Translate
‘inspired by thy divine command)

3. precor ut sequare ubl accipiat] lit. ‘ I pray thee,
to follow us as victors into our city, soon to be thine too, that
there a temple worthy of thy majesty may receive thee.'

sequare : for the subj. see App. IV. (α). Ubi accipiat:
ubi, a relative adverb,=ut ibi; the subjunctive therefore is
{gililafltlodhat after ‘qui’ (=ut ii) to express purpose: see

4. superante] ‘ overwhelmin g. '

quo minor sensus esset] cf. ve eo minm- tributi plebs con-
ferret. 5. 4, and see App. ΙΙ. (α) ἰί.

5. pro se quisque discum-unt] lit. ‘each one for himself’:
denotes the haste and disorder with which they flew to man
the walls: dixeurrunt, run in different directions. Notice
‘quisque' is nominative and sinsjulczr. It is in apposition to
‘Veintes.' It is hardly ever found in the plural number,
except in the neut. ; cf. 23. 5. The following sentences win
illustrate its use :—

Milites domum, cum sna quisque praedae, redeunt.

Milites, quem quisque ridel, cruridanc.

Suum cuique tribuito=give each one his due.
From these it will be seen that ‘quisque‘ is used of each
sever-al 'ca-ee, where there are n-lgre than two, and remains in
the singular though the verb may be plural. See Roby,
S.L.G. §Q 522, and ef. note to ll. 4.

quidnam id esset, quod] ‘what was the reason that...¹
For the subjunctives see App. [V.

7. vocem exauditum esse] indirect statement aster ‘ fabulass
