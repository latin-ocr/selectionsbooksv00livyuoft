NOTES.

1. Bo anno] i.e. ΕΟ. 398, two years before the fall of Veii.

tribum militares cons. potest] ‘military tribunes with
consular power.‘ In B.c. 445 the plebeians demanded that
the consulship, the chief magistracy in the state. should be
thrown open to them. It had formerly been held exclusively
by the patricians, who now effeeted a compromise with the
lower order, by which, instead of the two consuls, a larget-
numher of magistrates, to be called ‘ tribuni militares con-
sulari potestates should be annually elected, chosen without
distinction from patriciaus and plebeians. They were to have
the same powers as the consuls, i.e. the right of administer-ing
justice, and performing civil functions, iu addition to the
supreme command οἱ the armies. This arrangement continued
in force till Rc. 367, at which date the plebeinns obtained
admission to the consulship itself. The ‘trib. milit. cons.
potest.’ are to be distinguished from the ‘tribuni militum‚·‘
who were merely military officere, six of whom were attached
to each legion.
